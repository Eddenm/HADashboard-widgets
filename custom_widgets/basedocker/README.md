# A Docker control widget for HADashboard and Appdaemon Version 4

![HADashboard-widgets](https://github.com/tjntomas/HADashboard-widgets/blob/master/img/docker_app.jpg?raw=true)

## Features
* Start, stop or restart docker containers
* Shows the uptime and current status of the containers
* Creates docker entities in Home Assistant for each discovered container
* Can handle multiple docker hosts, i.e. docker containers running on multiple machines on your local network.
* The controls blinks when status is changing, i.e. during restart, start or stop of a container
* Use the docker entities in your Home Assistant Lovelace UI if you like
* Trigger automations when a container starts or stops or reaches a certain uptime duration etc.

## How it works
An Appdaemon app is grabbing all containers on a host through the docker API and creates docker entities in Home Assistant.
The app adds three  internal Appdaemon services which is called by the widget when one of the control icons is pressed:
* docker/start
* docker/stop
* docker/restart

  ### Controlling a docker container from Home Assistant
  You can control a docker container by firing one of the following events with entity_id of the docker entity as data:
  * docker_start
  * docker_stop
  * docker_restart

### Prerequisites

* You need to have Appdaemon 4 installed and working
* You need to enable the remote API for dockerd. See instructions here: https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-enable-the-remote-api-for-dockerd. (Activating the dockerd API is also useful if you are using portainer since you can then control multiple machines running docker through portainer)

## How to set it up

### Install the Appdaemon app

Copy the ````dock.py```` file from https://github.com/tjntomas/HADashboard-widgets/tree/master/apps to your ````apps```` folder in your Appdaemon config folder.

Add the following to your apps.yaml file:
````yaml
docker:
  module: dock
  class: Docker
  hosts:
    ip_or_host_name_of_machine_running_docker: 2376  # For example 192.168.1.20:2376. 2376 is the default api port for dockerd.
    ip_or_host_name_of_another_machine_running_docker: 2376
    
  # PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ABOVE HOSTS KEY IS NOT A YAML LIST, I.E. NO INITIAL DASH.
````

Now, you should see entities created in Home Asssistant with the domain "docker", for instance ````docker.appdaemon```` with the following attributes:
````yaml
  uptime: About an hour
  image: acockburn/appdaemon:4.0.1
  host: ub2
  id: b8f60c5846cc4166c421742aca6d5c520d04cb8bea892720fe42b89fefe33e37
  state: Running
  container: appdaemon
  ````
  
  ### Install the docker widget
  * Copy the ````docker.yaml```` file and the ````basedocker```` folder from here https://github.com/tjntomas/HADashboard-widgets/tree/master/custom_widgets to your ````custom_widgets```` folder inside your Appdaemon config folder.
  * add the following to your custom_css variables.yaml file:
  ````yaml:
  docker_title_style: $style_title
  docker_widget_style: $background_style
  ````
  
  ### Add a widget
  
  Add the following to your ````.dash```` file:
  
  ````yaml
  ha:
    widget_type: docker
    entity: docker.home_assistant # Check the name of the created docker entities in the state explorer in Home Assistant.
    title: Home Assistant
  ````
  and add ha(2x2) to the display sections in the .dash file:
  ````yaml
  layout:
  - ha(2x2)
  
  ````

### Done!

If you want, you can change the ````Uptime````, ````Host```` and ````State```` text to your own language by adding the corresponding keys to the widget definition:
  ````yaml
  ha:
    widget_type: docker
    entity: docker.home_assistant  # Check the name of the created docker entities in the state explorer in Home Assistant.
    title: Home Assistant
    uptime: Gångtid  # Swedish
    state: Status
    host: Värd
  ````
